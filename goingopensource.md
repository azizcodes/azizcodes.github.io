Below is my recommended list of open source software. I talk about some of these programs throughout the blog but I thought of having everything in one page for quick access. For further reading and documentation for some of these programs, see my [resources page](/resources/)

Replacing Microsoft Office,
* Word → Office Libre [Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/). Or write in markdown and convert it to HTML, TeX, or pdf using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (requires [pdflatex](http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/))
* Excel → [Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/), [Gnumeric](http://gnumeric.org/) is pretty good too
* Powerpoint → [Impress](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/). [Revealjs](https://revealjs.com/#/)
* Access → Not as easy but you can use [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* For mobile phones, there is a an Office Libre that enables you to view them
* PDF Reader → [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Use anything by Mozilla. Set it as the default program to open pdfs
* Notepad → [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* Mail → use a web client, like [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/)
* (Very) long Documents → [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/)

Doing Computations,
* Matlab → Python (see the blog). Just download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and be a "data scientist"

Plotting,
* Excel → Javascript's [D3 Library](https://d3js.org/) (see the blog). Note: steep learning curve due to less available documentation. Go with Python for ease of use

OS,
* Windows, Mac → [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and its flavors like [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/). If you must use Windows or Mac, use them with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) ad [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Photos,
* Vector → [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
* Raster → [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)
* Conversion → [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
* Organization → [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/)

Torrents,
* μTorrent → [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)

Wikis,
* () → [Zim](https://zim-wiki.org/)
* () → [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)

Blogging,
* () → [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
* () → [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Teach yourself to do everything in text, and learn the Linux command line (see my [resources page](/resources/)), and maybe some web technology ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) are good sources).

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
