Over the past few years, my Android hotspot was always at the IP address 

```
192.168.43.1
```
and apparently it was the same for everyone. It never changed, so I wrote my scripts accordingly. Now, however, I see a new IP address every few days, which sucks. It meant a rewrite of al existing code that connects my computer to the phone. In the process, I learned a few things or got to practice my skills. 

It's possible that they did this so that whoever gains access to a computer that was set up to access an Android phone, won't be able to access the phone without more information, but I am not sure. 

So, first a function that gets the IP address from within the phone

``` bash
get_ip_address(){
	ip a | grep 192.168. | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/\/.*//' 
}
```
On the computer, a function that tries to connect to the phone using the IP address if it exists, if not, prompts you to input it

``` bash
connect_to_phone() {
        echo "connecting to $IP"
        ssh -p 8022 $IP 
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then 
                echo "Connection failed. Get the IP address from your phone."
                read -p "Answer 'yes' if you want to set it up > "
                if [ "$REPLY" == "yes" ]; then
                        read -p "what's the IP address? > "
                        export IP=$REPLY
                fi
        fi
}
```
The new thing to learn for me is that emacs can use these environment variables with the command `(getenv)`. Then I can then construct command strings using `(concat)`, and execute them.
