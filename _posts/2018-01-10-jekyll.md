# Installing Jekyll on Windows 

Jekyll is for making static blogs, like this one.

Please note that I don't recommend installing it on a Windows. The below is assuming you have no other choice to increase your productivity. That said, here are the [installation instructions on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/). If you are using the Ruby installer, you might want to [install MSYS separately](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/). You will get the pacman package manager as a plus for this installtion. Then, if you are like me, you might get stuck with [this issue](https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/598) for a long time. Here is how to solve it:

```
gem install ffi -f
bundle update
```

Another tip, use Sublime Text for editing the blog. You can have the folder tree on the right pane open as many tabs as necessary for editing. I was using vi this whole time.

This is the first thing in any post.

## Internal links

It should be easier than external links but it's actually harder (these links are generated every time you update the blog). 

### Posts

To refer to the post `2018-01-10-post.md` in the directory `_posts`:

{% raw %}
```
[Internal post]({% post_url 2018-01-10-post %})
```
{% endraw %}


### Pages

To refer to a page in the root directory of the blog, type

```
[Internal page](/page.html)
```
### Internal Images

```
![Internal image]({{ "/assets/image.png" | absolute_url }})
```

## Raw
You can ignore liquid tags [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16256799/ignore-a-specific-tag-in-jekyll).
