After [setting up your SSH connection]() you can use TRAMP to access files on emacs, which is easier for browsing files using dired. You can visit the home folder, for example, with 

``` emacs
C-x C-f /ssh:user@IP#8022:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/`
```

Where `IP` is the IP of the phone relative to the laptop (`192..`).

It can run shells too ([3 different shells actually]()) inside emacs, e.g. `M-x shell /ssh:user@IP#8022:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash` 

You might run into problems running programs with this shell inside emacs like I did because the environment variable `$PATH` (which tells your computer where to look for programs to execute) was not set correctly because it was using a different startup script than what I was getting with normal SSH. 

To learn more about this, you can read about `{login,nonlogin}{interactive,noninteractive} shells` (the general idea is that different systems load different startup scripts). I don't know which ones TRAMP uses but I know (through trial and error) that is uses `~/.bashrc`. 

So, I added the following to `~/.bashrc` and now programs accessed from the shell within emacs work:

``` bash
export PATH="$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin" # where termux keeps programs
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"                           # if you have programs in that folder
```
