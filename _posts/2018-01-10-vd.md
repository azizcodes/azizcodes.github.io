[Visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) is an excellent program for handling CSVs in a command line environment. Good for quick operations to explore the data, such as sorting, cleaning, analysis, and even basic plotting. 


``` bash
pip install visidata
```

Can also 

``` bash
visidata file.csv
```

Can be shortned to `vd` in some environments. You can read a file without a header from the stdin, for example

``` bash
cat file.csv | vd  --header=0 
```
# Operations

* `q` exits
* `ESC` cancels
* `h`, `l`, `j`, `k` for movements (as you would in Vim)
* `H`, `L`, `J`, `K` for moving rows and columns in differnt directions
* `[` and `]` sorts
* `-` deletes column
* `d` deletes row
* Specifying type of column data `@` date, `#` integer, `$` currency, `%` float
* `!` designates a column as a key, e.g. to plot data against
* `.` plots data. A key column should be speficied before, as well as the data type in the column(s) to be plotted
* `SHIFT+F` frequency
* `SHIFT+I` statistics
* `W` pivot table
* `+` aggregator
* `s` `t` `u` select, toggle, and unselect current row 
* `"` start a new sheet with the selected row(s)
* `z+` displays result of aggregator over values in selectd rows for current column. 
* `|` select rows matching a regex
* `=` evaluates a python expression, such as a condition `a>1000`. The above operation can then be used to select matching rows

## It is not just CSVs

Anything that can be opened with pandas can be opened with visidata. So this includes excel and html, and even URIs. This is powerful: the capability of pandas and the speed and versatility of the command line.

For example, you can search for your engine oil from this table

```
vd https://www.gmdexos.com/brands/dexos1/index.html
```

it may prompt you to install `lxml` if you dont have it

``` bash
pip install lxml
```
