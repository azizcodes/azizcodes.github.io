Excellent program for handling CSVs in a command line environment. Good for quick operations to explore the data, such as sorting, cleaning, analysis, and even basic plotting.
Worth noting it is based on Python, and uses it expressions.


``` bash
pip install visidata
```

Can also 

``` bash
visidata file.csv
```

Can be shortned to `vd` in some environments. You can read a file without a header from the stdin, for example

``` bash
cat file.csv | vd  --header=0 

```

# Operations

* `q` exits
* `ESC` cancels
* `h`, `l`, `j`, `k` for movements (as you would in Vim)
* `H`, `L`, `J`, `K` for moving rows and columns in differnt directions
* `[` and `]` sorts
* `-` deletes column
* `d` deletes row
* Specifying type of column data `@` date, `#` integer, `$` currency, `%` float
* `!` designates a column as a key, e.g. to plot data against
* `.` plots data. A key column should be speficied before, as well as the data type in the column(s) to be plotted
* `SHIFT+F` frequency
* `SHIFT+I` statistics
* `W` pivot table
* `+` aggregator
* `s` `t` `u` select, toggle, and unselect current row 
* `"` start a new sheet with the selected row(s)
* `z+` displays result of aggregator over values in selectd rows for current column. is pretty handy. Often, this is what we want from a CSV, a quick sum or an average.
* `|` select rows matching a regex
* `=` evaluates a python expression, such as a condition `a>1000`. The above operation can then be used to select matching rows
