In Linux, use `xclip`

``` bash
echo hi | xclip
```
Now its copied to the clipboard and you can paste it using, and this is important, the middle mouse button (and not `Ctrl+v` or `Ctrl+V`).

In termux, to copy some text use:

``` bash
termux-clipboard-set some text
```
This text can now be pasted into other apps. `termux-clipboard-set` reads from standard input so you can do, for example

``` bash
cat file.txt | termux-clipboard-set 
```
To copy what's on the screen to the clipboard.
