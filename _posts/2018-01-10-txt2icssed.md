# A simple sed script to convert txt files to ics
This tool converts txt files (formatted in a specific way) into ics events on a calendar. It's mostly useless except as a good SED exercise and reference. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/azizcodes/txt2ics_sed).

## USAGE
Open a terminal window, go to this directory where tl.sed and journal.txt are located and execute like this: 

```
sed -f tl.sed journal.txt|sed ':begin;/END:VEVENT/! N;/\\n\n/s/\n//;tbegin;P;D'|sed -e '1i\BEGIN:VCALENDAR' -e '$a\END:VCALENDAR' -e 's/END:VEVENT$/\nEND:VEVENT/'
```

 The generated ics should be ready for import to most calendars.

## INPUT FILE 
A 'journal.txt' file formatted like this

```
Wednesday 10:29 AM 05/24/2017

-Day of the week, then date and time in the above format.
-The dash at the beginning of each point is necessary.
 . This is how I do sublists (optional)
  .. And subsublists (optional)
-At least four dashes at the beginning of the line  to mark the end the list, as below.

-More features in this note.
-It is useful to use keyboard shortcuts for marking tasks (F3). #Task
-And projects (F4).            #Project 
-And mark things as done (F2). #Done!
-And (F6) for the line below. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Output
Here is what you get after executing the code on the given sample file:

```
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT
SUMMARY:TO-DO List20170524
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20170524 
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20170524

## The SED Code
I'll write an explanation when I have time. Here is the code for now:
```
1	s/\<[0-9]\>/0&/g # padding with zeros, if needed
2	s/\([0-9]\{2\}\)\/\([0-9]\{2\}\)\/\([0-9]\{4\}\)/\3\1\2/ # converting dates
       
3	s/[A-Z][a-z][a-z][a-z]*[a-z]*[a-z]*day ..:.. .. \(20[0-9]\{6\}\)/BEGIN:VEVENT\nSUMMARY:TO-DO List\1\nDTSTART;VALUE=DATE:\1 \nDTEND;VALUE=DATE:\1\nDESCRIPTION:/
4	/----/c\END:VEVENT\
       
5	/DESCRIPTION:/,/END:VEVENT/{                          #edit all lines between DESCRIPTION: and END:VEVENT
6	                             /END:VEVENT/!{s/$/\\n/}} #if it's not the last line, replace $ with \n
```
