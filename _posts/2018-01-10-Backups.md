# Back Up Tools

 
## Full Back up

### Clonezilla
This makes an image of your disk that is a lot smaller than the size of the data on it. A great advantage. **HOWEVER, the media you are restoring to must be equal or larger to the original image.** As I discuss in [my post on portable linux]({% post_url 2018-01-10-PortableLinux %}), this means that when you have a portable Linux on a 32 GB, you are stuck with that size or larger if you want to restore it, even if the OS on it is only 16 GB. If you restore it to 64 GB partition that will be the new size you are working with, and so on.

[You can get Clonezilla from here](http://clonezilla.org/).

## File backup

### Windows
I highly recommend [DSynchronize](http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/).

### Unix

You can use rsync, as follows:

```
rsync -av --delete /Directory1/ /Directory2/
```

You can read more about rsync [here](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-backup-files-linux-rsync-command-line).
