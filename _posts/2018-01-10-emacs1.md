I am a big fan of command line tools, and I am convinced with the usefulness of Unix philosophy as one tool for the job. So what is emacs good for? Recently I started learning emacs (downloadable from [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)), and I can give you at least 5 good reasons to learn it:

1. *Org mode*. This simple and elegant tool is the best personal organizer of all time.
2. *Support for Unicode*. Terminals don't support Arabic and other Unicode, Emacs is a good cross platform solution to deal with this problem. 
3. *TRAMP*. This is another great feature, you can browse files on other computers as if they were on yours.
4. *Info*. A great tool for browsing open source software. This is how I started learning Emacs, I was looking up something else using `info`. 
5. *Buffers*. A good why for organizing things.

I can go on. I can also mention IDEs, Magit, browsers, etc. In short, it is an integrated solution to the needs of a software developer. I don't understand why people compare it to Vim, which is a better text editor, but does only that. To learn emacs, check out the [mastering emacs](https://masteringemacs.org) blog, or get the book.

## Org Mode

For a quick overview, watch [this on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4). To learn it, see the following references

1. Info `C-h i` then click on Org Mode.
2. Their [compact guide](https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf).
3. Their [reference card](https://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf).

## Arabic

Press `C-\` and type `arabic` when prompted for an input method. You can change the direction of paragraph as follows

```
M-x set-variable RET bidi-paragraph-direction RET right-to-left RET
```

## Tramp

To connect to something with SSH using TRAMP, use the following syntax
```
/ssh:user@ip#port:/file_address
```
For setting it up on Windows, check out [this post](https://creechy.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/)

## Info

As mentioned before, `C-h i` starts info. You can browse using this tool or use the stand alone version.


## Buffers

You can move around text buffers (which can be, for example, interactive shells) easily with `C-x →` or `C-x ←`.
