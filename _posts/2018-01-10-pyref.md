## Reading from `stdin`

You can read from the standard input as follows


``` bash
seq 10 | python -c 'import sys;print(sum([int(k) for k in sys.stdin.readlines()]))'
```

## Reading History

``` python
import readline
for i in range(readline.get_current_history_length()):
    print (readline.get_history_item(i + 1))
```
For some reason this isn't working on my Windows 7 computer.


Update: it's in `~/.python_history`. Open that as a text file.

## No More Ugly Loops

No more of this ugliness (I used to write this way in my earlier posts in this blog)

``` python
for k in range(len(x)):
```
Instead, use `enumerate` and `zip`.

### Enumerate

Enumerates a list.
``` python
x=[1,2,3]
for j,k in enumerate(x):
    print(j,k)
```

### Zip

Makes an iterator from two lists.
``` python
x=[1,2,3]
y=[4,5,6]
for j,k in zip(x,y):
    print(j,k)
```

## Reading Text

You don't always have to save text files. Use StringIO.

``` python
from io import StringIO

s='''
COUNTRY,GDP (BILLIONS),CODE
Afghanistan,21.71,AFG
'''
df=pd.read_csv(StringIO(s))
```

## case.. esac

Python does case statements differently. 

``` python 
# case statements in python
```
