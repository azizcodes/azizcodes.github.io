Suppose you wanna iterate over a number of things, such as the sequence 1..10, or the directory listing (the output of the `ls` command), or lines in a file.
To do this in Bash, use the following syntax (where `WORD` and `LIST` are according to the definitions in the [Bash man page](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)).

``` bash
for k in WORDs ; do LIST; done
```
You have options on how to specify `WORDs`, including *expansions*, *substitutions*, or writing them out by hand.

Let's start with expansions. You can use a *brace expansion*, which are evaluated before any commands are executed

``` bash
$ echo {1..10}
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

So, the following statements are equivelant:

``` bash
for k in {1..10}; do echo $k; done
for k in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do echo $k; done
```

Alternatively, use the output of the `seq` command with with *command substitution*, where the value of the command is substituted in place of the command

``` bash
$ seq 10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

$ echo  $(seq 10)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

So we can then say, again equivelant to the above,

``` bash
for k in $(seq 10); do echo $k; done
```

Let's take another example, iterating over the directory listing. It can be done with command substitution this way

```
for k in $(ls); do echo $k; done 
```

and can be done with a *wildcard expansion* (another kind of expansion) this way

```
for k in *; do echo $k; done
```

Another substitution is *process substitution*, which enables referring to the output of a command as a filename. So for example, if the syntax of the command is 

```
$ cat FILE
```

Where file contains a list of numbers obtained using *redirection* with `seq 10 > FILE`. You can use

```
$ cat <(seq 10)
```

The above is redundant since we can just write `seq 10` to show the result. Another one, let's read a file line by line and echo it to the screen

``` bash
while read line; do echo $line; done < <(seq 10)
```
what happens when you echo a file name?

``` bash
$ echo <(seq 10)
/proc/self/fd/63
```
Here is a better usage of process substitution, since its asynchronous, lets use it with the curl command

``` bash
$ grep bash <(curl https://azizcodes.github.io)
```
