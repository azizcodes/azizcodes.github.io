When writing a bash script, how to know whether you are on WSL or not? This affects some things, such as the location of your `~/Documents` folder. 

For example, suppose you are copying `file1` to the `~/Documents` folder, which is `/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents` under WSL. Here are two ways to do this. 

The explicit way

``` bash
docs=~/Documents
grep 'Microsoft' /proc/version > /dev/null 2>&1 && docs=/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents
cp file1 $docs/
```
The implicit way

``` bash
sync="cp file1 ~/Documents/"
sync_wsl="cp file1 /mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents/"
eval $sync || eval $sync_wsl
```

I like the implicit way. It doesn't require the knowledge of the Linux version info.
