Cool, right?

Learning to use this library, [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials), has been a goal of mine for some time. I couldn't progress much because I didn't know any javascript, which I am working on right now. Got ["the definitive guide" from O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781449393854/) and installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the interpreter and learning to make sentences "loops and branching", a process that worked well with Python and faster with Bash..

So back to D3, how does that work?

If you want to get started on D3 but find it hard it to use, you can try [RAW](https://github.com/densitydesign/raw/wiki) as a start.

I made an account at [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@azizcodes) (by the creator of D3). Nothing there yet but wait and see!
