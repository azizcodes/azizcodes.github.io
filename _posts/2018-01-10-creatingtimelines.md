# Creating Timelines
Free tools to create timelines.

## Horizontal Timelines

### 1. TimelineJS
This is the best one, the only drawback is that it requires using Google sheets.

### 2. Timeline-Setter
This is functional but looks kinda old and nothing special about it.

### 3. The TimelineProject
This one generates static timelines.

### 4. PowerPoint Plugin
You should know about it this plugin. However, this is not a free tool since PowerPoint is not free.
