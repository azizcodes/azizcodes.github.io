# Requests and Arguments

This short program takes a url as an argument and returns the HTML to stdout. Useful for quick searches.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import sys

def printsoup(url):
    r=requests.get(url)
    soup=BeautifulSoup(r.content,"html.parser")
    print(soup)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = sys.argv[1]
    printsoup(url)
```
