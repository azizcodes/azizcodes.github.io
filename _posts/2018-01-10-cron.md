Here is how you set up cron. 

```
crontab -e 
```
Opens the crontab where a list of jobs are stored. For example, this program prints the date every minute to `test1.txt`:


```
* * * * * date >> ~/test1.txt
```

For help with setting time intervals, check out [this website](https://crontab.guru/)

Then, don't forget to activate the daemon! Like this

```
crond
```
