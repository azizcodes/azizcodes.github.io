# ICS to CSV Converter
If you would like to convert a list of dates into calendar events, take a look at [this code](https://n8henrie.com/2013/05/spreadsheet-to-calendar/).

## Input

The author of the above code gave this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0eJMoytqFNn6G2QS3cEo2Of350lKF6x3gbEvbfMnkA/edit#gid=1). Download the Google sheet as CSV:

*File > Download As.. > Comma-separated values*

When filling the table with dates, make sure they are in mm/dd/yyyy. I initially filled it like this[^1]:

| Subject | Start Date | Start Time | End Date   | End Time | All Day Event | Description | Location | Private |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|----------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Event 1 | 2017-01-29 |            | 2017-02-03 |          | TRUE          |             |          | TRUE    |
| Event 2 | 2017-04-03 |            | 2017-04-08 |          | TRUE          |             |          | TRUE    |
| Event 3 | 2017-05-18 |            | 2017-05-20 |          | TRUE          |             |          | TRUE    |

The program raises an error because it only accepts dates in this format mm/dd/yyyy. I wrote [datefixer](https://github.com/azizcodes/datetimetools/blob/master/datefixer.py) to adjust the dates. 

```
python datefixer.py 
```

## Output
An ICS file containing the above events.
