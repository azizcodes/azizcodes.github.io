## The Problem
The problem is writing code for personal accounting for a person with 4 accounts but receiving income on one only, and using all of them for payments and transfers. But first: understanding the physics.

The governing equation is,

$$\Delta=\sum I-\sum L$$

For $$I$$ and $$L$$ that cross the system boundary (in green below). $$I$$ and $$L$$ for accounts $$1$$ through $$4$$ are known as total in and out of each account, but not each stream. My goal is to calculate each term in this equation

$$\Delta = I_1-(L'_1+L_2+L'_3+L_4) $$

to find $$\sum L$$.

## Notation
$$I_1$$ is the total income for account $$1$$. 

$$I'_1$$ is the part of the income for account $$1$$ coming from the 1st stream.  

$$L'''_2$$ is the part of the loss for account $$2$$ going to the 3rd stream. 
And so on.


## Calculations
### Method 1

For a single income account, 

$$\sum I=I_1$$

Money flows out in 3 directions out of the 1st account,

$$L_1=L'_1+L''_1+L'''_1$$

$$L''_1$$ and $$L'''_1$$ are known quantities:

$$L_1=L'_1+I_2+I_3$$

Money flows out in 2 directions out of the 3rd account,

$$L_3=L'_3+L''_3$$


$$L''_3$$ is a known quantity:


$$L_3=L'_3+I_4$$


Therefore,

$$L'_1=L_1-(I_2+I_3)$$

and

$$L'_3=L_3-I_4$$

which can be substituted in the above equation to get $$\Delta$$ and $$\sum L$$.

### Method 2
This approach is inspired by the conservation equations of physics:

$$\Delta=\Delta_1+\Delta_2+\Delta_3+\Delta_4$$

where

$$\Delta_i=I_i-L_i$$

Knowing the total income you can get the total losses by using the governing equation above. However, this appears confusing because it is a difference between larger numbers than the first method (because it accounts for the internal interactions between accounts), but it's the same $$\Delta$$. So,

$$L_{ext}=I_{ext}-\Delta$$

where in this case

$$I_{ext}=I_1$$

This phenomenon of *flow* is all over nature (e.g. calculating the change in internal energy and entropy of a system) and it has always confused me by its simplicity. I am writing this down to stop being confused by it!
