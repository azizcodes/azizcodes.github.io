Octave is FOSS matlab. It can read `.m` files and `.mat` variables.

Open a text file octaveplot and type an `m` file `octaveplot.m`

``` matlab
x=0:10;y=exp(x); [x' y']
plot(x,y,'-ok')
pause
```
pipe it to octave with the quiet option `-q`

``` bash
cat octaveplot.m | octave -q
```

That will print a table of the values of the exponential function and plots it. The beauty of this is that you can draw plots in a text environment (such as Termux), too.  That used to work on my phone but now is giving me a "bus error". Octave uses `gnuplot` for its plotting under the hood.
