A simple form that interacts with a database. Check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/azizcodes/6a5a2e95482b9399a22e8ad8c5cae4f1). 

[Here](https://bl.ocks.org/azizcodes/raw/6a5a2e95482b9399a22e8ad8c5cae4f1/) is what that form looks like.

Then, to display the data using javascript, here is what you need to add to the bottom of `form_processing.php`

``` html
<script type='text/javascript'>

<?php
$sql2="SELECT * FROM dummy.logs2";
$arr = pg_fetch_all($result2);
//print_r($arr);

$php_array = $arr;
$js_array = json_encode($php_array);
echo "var javascript_array = ". $js_array . ";\n";

pg_close($conn);
?>
</script>
```
