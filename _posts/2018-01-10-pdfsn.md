This post is about doing things the open source way, using tools like Ghostscript and ImageMagick.

## Conversion
Use Imagemagick's convert function.
```
convert file.jpeg file.pdf
```
Or, you can make a collection of photos in one PDF
```
 convert [files] outputfile
```
## Merging
When you combine PDFs the outcome can be of low resolution. You can use Ghostscript to improve the results
```
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=temp.pdf pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf
```
## Deleting
Use the print function. You can specify ranges when printing like this
```
1-5,6-8
```
# Update

## Concatenating PDFs
I found [here](https://gotofritz.net/blog/joining-pdf-files-in-os-x-from-the-command-line/) a simpler and better solution to the problem described above 
```
pdfconcat -o resume_sadaya.pdf itresume.pdf resume_20201215.pdf
```

## Converting an HTML to PDF
You can convert an html file to pdf by printing. However, if the page you're printing contains links, they would be gone.  If you would like to retain the links, I found this tool to be helpful: wkhtmltopdf.  To use it, run the command
```
wkhtmltopdf --page-size A5 itresume.html itresume.pdf
```
Use the following if you run into the error described [here](https://www.itsolutionstuff.com/post/solved-qxcbconnection-could-not-connect-to-display-wkhtmltopdf-ubuntuexample.html), use
```
xvfb-run wkhtmltopdf --page-size A5 itresume.html itresume.pdf
```
