I have been using vim for a long time as my favorite text editor but havent gone through its introductory tutorial
```
vimtutor
```
Check it out, good stuff there. However, it's really a small subset from what Vim can do.

## Notable features
In the following, some features of note that are not included in `vimtutor`. You can read more about them in the help files.

### Splitting Windows
To split horizontally
```
:split
```
To split vertically
```
:vsplit
```
These two commands show two views of the same file when used without an argument. Just add the filename you want if you'd like to see it side by side
```
:vs filename
```
I used the abbreviated form of `:vs`. To close windows
```
:close
```
To navigate through split windows,
```
CTRL-W + navigation keys
```

### Moving lines
`:m`


## Cool plugins
The following plugins are of interest for programmers
* NERDTree
* Taglist, good for browsing through tags

A note on installation.
