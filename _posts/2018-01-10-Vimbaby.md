I have been using vim for a long time as my favorite text editor but havent gone through its introductory tutorial
```
vimtutor
```
Check it out, good stuff there. However, it's really a small subset from what Vim can do. There is also extensive help when you excute the command `:help` from within Vim. Check out `:h quickref` for a quick reference.

## Notable features
In the following, some features of note that are not included in `vimtutor`. You can read more about them in the help files.

### Basics
Vim has differet modes: *Normal*, *Insert*, and *Visual* modes. **The following commmands all run in normal mode**.

To undo and redo changes, use:
* Undo `u`
* redo `CTRL+R`

### Navigation 
* Page up `CTRL-U`
* Page down `CTRL-D`

Summary:
* A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
* A window is a viewport on a buffer.
* A tab page is a collection of windows.

### Splitting Windows
* To split horizontally `:split`
* To split vertically `:vsplit`

These two commands show two views of the same file when used without an argument. Just add the filename you want if you'd like to see it side by side

```
:vs filename
```
I used the abbreviated form of `:vsplit`. To close windows `:close`

To navigate through split windows,
```
CTRL-W + navigation keys
```
To close all other windows `CTRL-W + o`.


### Tab page
You can open tabpages instead. As follows:
```
tabnew filename
```
See `:h tabpage` for more info.

### Moving lines
Place the cursor on a line then use 
```
:m10
```
to move it to the 10th line. To display line numbers,
```
:set number
```
and use `:set nonumber` to undo this.


### Visual mode
I will give an example of moving text around within a file. 

1. Press `v` to enter visual mode
2. Highlight the text using navigation keys
3. Press `d` to delete it (it would would move it to a register)
4. Move the cursor to where you want to put it, and press `p`.

Using commands, you can do [the following](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4224410/macro-for-making-numbered-lists-in-vim):
```
command! -nargs=0 -range=% Number <line1>,<line2>s/^\s*\zs/\=(line('.') - <line1>+1).'. '
```

## Cool plugins
The following plugins are of interest for programmers
* NERDTree, to display the file tree
* Taglist, good for browsing through tags
* Ultisnip, for auto completion
