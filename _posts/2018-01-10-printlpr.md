Before we get into printing, I highly recommend reading a little on printing history in _The Linux Command Line_.

I rarely have a printer connected, it is often convenient to store the output to a PDF to be sent to a printer later. On Linux, you might want to install `cups-pdf` to print to PDF while practicing instead of wasting the precious printer papers.


# pr
Prepares text files for printing.

``` bash
  ls -1 | pr -4 -t 
```
The first part of this pipeline lists the files in one columns. The `pr` command then rearranges them to 4 columns. With the `-t` option, the headers and footers are not displayed.

# lpr

``` bash
  ls -1 | pr -4 -t -o 1 | lpr
```
The output is under `~/PDF/`.
  
  
# lp

With characters per inch (CPI) and lines per inch (LPI), this command is provides more functionality

``` bash
  ls -1 | pr -4 -t -o 1 | lp -o page-left=34 -o cpi=20
```

# gs

For graphical printers (like those using PostScript), you can use `a2ps` (anything to PostScript)

``` bash
ls /usr/bin | pr -3 -t | a2ps -o ~/Desktop/ls.ps -L 66
```
