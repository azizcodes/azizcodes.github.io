## Common commands
```
install
show
list
```

## Which of my package managers installed `npm`?

If I run `which npm`, I get the following

```
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/npm

```

However, if I search for npm in the ubuntu package manager.

```
apt list|grep ^n

```

So it exists in apt too. How do I tell linux to use the version installed with apt?

```
echo $PATH|sed 's/:/\\n/g'

```

we find the following candidates:

```
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/sbin
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/sbin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
snap/bin

```

Let's look in /usr/local/bin:

```
ls /usr/local/bin|grep ^n
n
node
npm
npx

```

Show the installed packages

```
/usr/local/bin/npm ls

```

Instead of the above, you can just do

```
which -a npm
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/npm
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/npm
/usr/local/bin/npm

```
