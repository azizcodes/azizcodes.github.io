I have recently been playing with emacs a lot and its calculator, Calc, is my latest obsession.

Let me clarify first that Calc is not simply a calculator, but a full computer algebra system. It's capable of matrix calculations for example. It uses RPN (reverse polish notation) by default, but has another normal (algebraic) calculator. Don't worry about RPN, it's easy to learn and just makes it fun to use.

* `C-x * *` starts calc
* `C-x * g` grabs text
* `C-x space`, then mark a rectangular region
* `C-x * :` sums columns
* `C-x * -` sums rows
* `v u` gets rid of the brackets. Now you can put the result right back in your text!
* `C-x * y` pastes the result where the point (cursor) is.

This integration is one of the powers of emacs. You'll rarely have to leave it. See the [calc card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/calccard.pdf) for more information on Calc.
