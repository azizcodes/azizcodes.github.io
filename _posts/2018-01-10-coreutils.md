Run the following command in bash,

``` bash
info coreutils
```
Alternatively, go on emacs (if it is installed), and `Ctrl-h i`, to see an overview of help topics. The `info` within emacs is more colorful than the standalone `info` program.

To get the manpages for bash, 

``` bash
info bash
```

a highly recommended read. To open the manpages on emacs, press `Alt-x man` or `Alt-x woman`.

The `man` command in Linux does something similar, however the navigation is `vi` like, unlike the `info` command which is `emacs` like.
