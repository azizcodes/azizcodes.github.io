## What's Wrong with the Cloud?

"The Cloud" sucks. There are limitations on storage capacity and the number of devices you can run the software on, not to mention the privacy. Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, are all less efficient than what's available freely. But, people don't know that because open source alternatives are usually not advertised because they are not profit seeking.

Suppose you are organizing photos. You take pictures on your phone, you back them up to your computer. Now you wanna categorize your pictures into albums, efficiently. On your computer, you have something like DigiKam to cateogrize them easily and quickly. However, maybe it is more efficient to categorize them on your phone, since you are carrying around with you all the time. Similarly, you could be using a program like Zim for note-taking, but you are using it on several computers which makes your note inaccessible when you travel around. 


## The Alternative

If you want to sync folder on different devices with each other, kinda the way Dropbox does it but on a local network, use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).
