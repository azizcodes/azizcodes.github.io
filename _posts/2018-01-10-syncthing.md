If you want to sync folder on different devices with each other, kinda the way Dropbox does it but on a local network, use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

Generally speaking, "Cloud Solutions" suck. There are limitations on storage capacity and the number of devices you can run the software on, not to mention the privacy. Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, are all less efficient than what's available freely. But, people don't know that because open source alternatives are usually not advertised because they are not profit seeking.
