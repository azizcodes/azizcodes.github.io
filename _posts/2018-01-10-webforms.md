## Web Forms

I simple way is using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I was surprised at how complicated it is to make a simple form, especially that the internet is full of them. Luckily, I found [Corey Schafer's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists). He has a very neat and comprehensive series on flask. But the application he is building in this series is much more than I needed, which is a simple customizable web form with fields that store data in a database. 

I kept looking, and I found [this tutorial on flask from tutorialspoit](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_sqlalchemy.htm).
