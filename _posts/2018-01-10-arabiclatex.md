# Pre-Requisites

1. [Install texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). Don't even bother with Windows.
2. Install xelatex (because that has [built in support for utf-8](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/XeLaTeX)). I think I got it from 
```
apt-get install texlive-xetex
```

# Tex Samples

You can get some [Arabic samples](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/arabic) from overleaf. I [modified one of these files](/assets/arab2.tex) and generated the [pdf](/assets/arab2.pdf).
