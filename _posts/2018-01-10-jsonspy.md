Yesterday's task was opening a very large JSON data file. 

JSON is a *serialized* text format. It has only one line so we can't display the first or last lines with `head` or `tail`.
But, it's still text, so we You can give it a quick look with cat

```
cat FILE
```

and just stare at words on the screen. Not very useful, let's see the first 1000 characters 

``` bash
grep -o '^.\{1000\}' FILE
```

We can see the beginning part but it really isn't saying much. What we want to see is the structure of the file, the *keys* of the key-value pairs.


We can do that with python

``` python
import json

jsf="" # the json file name
with open (jsf) as f:
    data=json.load(f)
    print(data.keys)
```

For the nested key-value pairs, we can look inside the same way. 

For example, suppose we have a property called "summary" whose value is `{"key1":value1,"key2":value2,...}` within this structure. This is how to display the keys:


``` python
import json

jsf="" # the json file name
with open (jsf) as f:
    data=json.load(f)
    print(data['summary'].keys)
```
