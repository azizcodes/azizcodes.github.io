I recently got an Android 13. I followed my usual procedure for setting up SSH, but it didnt' work.  Everywhere I searched online, the checklist to run in this case are the following:

1. Ensure the public key of the device attempting to connect is authorized on the server side
2. Check file permissions, 700 for the `.ssh` folder, 600 for the files inside of it 
3. Edit `sshd_config` in case the defaults changed

I tried increasing the verbosity with `ssh -vvvv`, I got some generic cryptic message about type 51, which apparently means it's not authenticating. Why? It doesn't say. After checking the sshd logs, it turned out the trouble was because of the permissions of my home folder. I changed that to 700 and it worked. 

You need to install `termux-services` to see the logs on termux.
