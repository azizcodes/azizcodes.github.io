This is a different approach to email than the IMAP set up of [gnus]({% post_url 2018-01-10-gnus %}) that I described earlier. In this approach, you have a folder synchronized to the email (using e.g. mbsync, as described [here]({% post_url 2018-01-10-synchronizingemails %})), and you do everything with a search. The program `mu` indexes your email folder, so it is faster than doing things on the web because it is a local folder. I used this approach to clean up my over +1000 unread emails, then reverted back to gnus to read emails as news, expiring articles and ticking only what needs to be ticked. Btw you can search your `IMAP` groups using the command `G G` in the `*group*` buffer. 

``` bash
sudo apt-get install mu
```

Put the following in `~/.emacs` and start emacs. Then the command `mu4e`.

``` elisp
(use-package mu4e
  :defer 20 ; Wait until 20 seconds after startup
  :config

  (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t ; avoid sync conflicts
      mu4e-update-interval (* 10 60) ; check mail 10 minutes
      mu4e-compose-format-flowed t ; re-flow mail so it's not hard wrapped
      mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -a"
      mu4e-maildir "~/Mail/proton")

  (setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/Drafts"
      mu4e-sent-folder   "/Sent"
      mu4e-refile-folder "/All Mail"
      mu4e-trash-folder  "/Trash")

  (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
      '(("/INBOX"     . ?i)
	("/Sent"      . ?s)
	("/Trash"     . ?t)
	("/Drafts"    . ?d)
	("/All Mail"  . ?a)))

  (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
      auth-sources '("~/.authinfo") ;need to use gpg version but only local smtp stored for now
      smtpmail-smtp-server "127.0.0.1"
      smtpmail-smtp-service 1025
      smtpmail-stream-type  'starttls))
```
