# GitHub Basics

## 1. Clone a Repository
**Scenario:** You think of an idea, you google it, you found that someone made an open source code on it, and you want to try it. 

```
git clone REPOSITORY
```

You don't have to have a GitHub account for this. All you need is to have git installed (comes with Unix-based computers, need to be installed for Windows)

Or, if you have an account, you can fork it (and that copies it to your GitHub account).

##  2. Push

**Scenario:** You downloaded the repository, made some changes on your computer, and you want to "push" these changes to your account on GitHub.

```
git add --all # adds your changes
git commit -m "message" # commits to them and adds a message
git push -u origin master # pushes the changes to the repository 
```
## 3. Pull
**Scenario:** You have a repository on your computer and you want to update it with changes you made on your GitHub account from another computer
```
git pull REPOSITORY
```
It's a little more complicated than that, see [this GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/) for more details.
