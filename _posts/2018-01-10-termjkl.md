The current installation process is the following
```
pkg install ruby libffi clang make
gem install jekyll
```
I have changed phones over the years and the dependencies change sometimes. Sometimes you need to specify the version of the gems in the Gemfile to make jekyll work (depending on the error messages during installation).

to  start jekyll, run the following inside the directory containing your blog.
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This time I had the opposite problem, the gems I specified previously were incompatible with the new version of ruby.

* Remove the requirements on the version numbers for gems in the Gemfile.
* Remove the `Gemfile.lock` (rename it temporarily first)

Then run
```
bundle install
```
This should reinstall the compatible versions. From here, troubleshoot as necessary then run jekyll again with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
