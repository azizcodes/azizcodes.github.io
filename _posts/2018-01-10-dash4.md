Heroku has been my latest obsession. The reason is it provides an easy way to build dynamic websites.

To explain, this blog is a static website (built with jekyll), and doesn't need a database server or any scripts running in the background. There are many free webhosts for such websites (like GitHub). However, such websites aren't interactive, and you can't get them to look something up or store data, for example. Heroku's [free plan](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) is plenty to work with and I have used it to host different kinds of projects: php, python, &c.

## Heroku with Dash
I gotta say it wasn't straight forward. I did host Flask instance to [pythonanywhere](http://azizcodes.pythonanywhere.com/) at some point in the past and it was a lot easier. However, I finally got Dash to work with Heroku. [Check it out](https://adash1.herokuapp.com/).


## Rails Website
Next I am going to deploy a Ruby on Rail website to Heroku. In progress for now.

## Note
I got the code from [here](https://github.com/plotly/dash-heroku-template) and updated it.
