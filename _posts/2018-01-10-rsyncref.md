One is confronted with a large set of options for the `rsync` command for the simple need of copying something *correctly*. To make things easy, I'll consider the two scenarios below. See [usage examples](https://rsync.samba.org/examples.html), or this [informative discussion](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67539/how-to-rsync-only-new-files).

The `rsync` syntax is like this 

``` bash
rsync options source destination
```

Note the following on adding a trailing slash from the manual page

``` txt

A  trailing  slash  on  the  source changes this behavior to avoid creating an additional directory level at the destination.  You can think of a
trailing / on a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed to "copy the directory by name", but in  both  cases  the  at‐
tributes  of the containing directory are transferred to the containing directory on the destination.  In other words, each of the following com‐
mands copies the files in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo:

       rsync -av /src/foo /dest
       rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo
```

## Syntax

To copy and leave old versions of the same file in place, use the command 

``` bash
rsync -av source destination
```

``

with options such as the following

``` bash
-v, --verbose               increase verbosity
-a, --archive               archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)
     --no-OPTION             turn off an implied OPTION (e.g. --no-D)
--update
--ignore-existing
--delete
```

## Use cases


### Simple copy

The following copies from source to destination like the `cp` command, while preserving attributes

``` bash
rsync -av source destination
```
The following two scenarios are opposite to each other

### Copying new files

Copying only new files and ignore the files that have a modified files in the source

``` bash
rsync -av --ignore-existing source destination
```

### Syncing

Updating the repository

``` bash
rsync -av --update source destination
```

### The "Dropbox" setting

Update if there is a new version in the source, delete if a file is deleted from the source, and add if there are new files.

``` bash
rsync -av --update --delete source destination && rsync -av --update destination source
```

### Backups 

Incremental backups

``` bash
DAY=`date "+%A"`
rsync -av --delete source destination/$DAY
```

## Explanation of `-a`

Let's break down the option `-a`:

``` bash
-r, --recursive             recurse into directories
-l, --links                 copy symlinks as symlinks
-p, --perms                 preserve permissions
-t, --times                 preserve modification times
-g, --group                 preserve group
     --devices               preserve device files (super-user only)
     --copy-devices          copy device contents as regular file
     --specials              preserve special files
-o, --owner                 preserve owner (super-user only)
-D                          same as --devices --specials
```

Option `-a` can be too strong of a condition and requiring adminstrative privilege. The safe options can be just enough

``` 
rsync -hPvrt
```
and possibly `-l` for symlinks, instead of `-a`.

## More options:

The following are commonly used options

``` bash
-z, --compress              compress file data during the transfer
-h, --human-readable        output numbers in a human-readable format
     --progress              show progress during transfer
-P                          same as --partial --progress
```


The following are less commonly used options

``` bash
 -H, --hard-links            preserve hard links
 -E, --executability         preserve the file\'s executability
     --chmod=CHMOD           affect file and/or directory permissions
```

If you want the destination folder to *mirror* the source folder, use the `--delete` option. Let's look at the manual again to understand this command.

``` bash
--delete
       This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones that aren’t on the sending side), but only for  the  directories
       that  are  being  synchronized.  **You must have asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. "dir" or "dir/") without using a wildcard for
       the directory’s contents (e.g. "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets a request to  transfer  individual
       files, not the files’ parent directory.**  Files that are excluded from the transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless you use the
       --delete-excluded option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers  in  the  FILTER  RULES
       section).

       Prior  to  rsync  2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless --recursive was enabled.  Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will also occur
       when --dirs (-d) is enabled, but only for directories whose contents are being copied.

       This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly!  It is a very good idea to first try a run using the --dry-run option (-n) to  see  what
       files are going to be deleted.

       If  the  sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files at the destination will be automatically disabled. This is to
       prevent temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from causing a massive deletion of files  on  the  destina‐
       tion.  You can override this with the --ignore-errors option.

       The  --delete  option  may  be combined with one of the --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as --delete-excluded.  However, if
       none of the --delete-WHEN options are specified, rsync will choose the --delete-during algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0 or newer, and
       the --delete-before algorithm when talking to an older rsync.  See also --delete-delay and --delete-after.
```

### Option `-e`

``` bash
-e, --rsh=COMMAND           specify the remote shell to use
     --rsync-path=PROGRAM    specify the rsync to run on the remote machine
     --existing              skip creating new files on receiver
     --ignore-existing       skip updating files that already exist on receiver
     --remove-source-files   sender removes synchronized files (non-dirs)
     --del                   an alias for --delete-during
     --delete                delete extraneous files from destination dirs
     --delete-before         receiver deletes before transfer, not during
     --delete-during         receiver deletes during the transfer
     --delete-delay          find deletions during, delete after
     --delete-after          receiver deletes after transfer, not during
     --delete-excluded       also delete excluded files from destination dirs
     --ignore-missing-args   ignore missing source args without error
     --delete-missing-args   delete missing source args from destination
     --ignore-errors         delete even if there are I/O errors
     --force                 force deletion of directories even if not empty
     --max-delete=NUM        don\'t delete more than NUM files
     --max-size=SIZE         don\'t transfer any file larger than SIZE
     --min-size=SIZE         don\'t transfer any file smaller than SIZE
     --partial               keep partially transferred files
     --partial-dir=DIR       put a partially transferred file into DIR
     --delay-updates         put all updated files into place at transfer\'s end
