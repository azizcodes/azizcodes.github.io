In this post, I show how to. Calc can be accessed with `C-x * *` from anywhere in emacs.

## Plot the exponential function from 0 to 5

First the range of x-values

``` 
v x 5 
```

Then get the y-values by copying the `x` vector, then mapping with an exponential function

```
RET
v M E
```

Now `g f` plots it. You plotted a curve with 8 keystrokes only.

## Plot sin(x) from 0 to 2 pi

The range can define the smoothness of the curve, lets use `pi/10`

```
N: 41
START: -2 pi
INCR: pi/10
```

The input to the calculator is as follows

```
41 RET 
0 RET P 2 * - 
P 10 / 
```

Now to get the range, use `v x` with a numerical argument `C-u`

```
C-u v x RET
```

As before, copy the vector and map it

```
RET 
v M S
g f
```

To get the plot.

## Plotting several graphs on the same axis

To do this you need to use `C-u g f`. Let's plot the following from 0 to 5. 

```
[x*exp(-x), x^2,*exp(-x), x^3*exp(-x)]
```

For the x values:

```
v x 5 RET
0 RET
TAB
v k
```

For the y values and plot:

```
v x 3 RET
v M ' x^n*exp(-x) RET (n) RET
C-u g f
```

## Using algebraic mode

Plotting sine from `-2 pi` to `2 pi`

```
0 RET P 2 * -
P 2 *
C-u -6 v p
' sin(x) RET
g f
```

The numerical argument of `-6` is to pack the first two entries to an interval. More information on _packing modes_ [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/calc/Packing-and-Unpacking.html).


* `g a` adds a curve to the plot (opens a *Gnuplots Commands* buffer to edit the plot details if necessary). 
* `g h` edits the plot title
* `g t` edit the x label
* `g T` edits the y label
* `g p` plots
