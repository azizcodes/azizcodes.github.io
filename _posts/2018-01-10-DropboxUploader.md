# Dropbox Uploader

This is a very useful script to upload files to Dropbox without installing it on your computer.


Why not just install Dropbox? Because space is precious on my [portable Linux system]({% post_url 2018-01-10-PortableLinux %}), and because they limit the devices you can install it on in the free version.


[Download and instructions here](https://www.andreafabrizi.it/2016/01/01/Dropbox-Uploader/
). In short, go to where you downloaded the file and type

```
./dropbox_uploader.sh 
```
You will find quick instructions there as well.
