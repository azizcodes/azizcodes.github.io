This is called a *shell variable*

``` bash
VAR=192.168.43.1
```

and this is called an *environment variable*

``` bash
export VAR=192.168.43.1
```
How are they different? The scope of the first is restricted to the current shell.
If you start another session (e.g. an ssh connection) it would be gone.
I just found this out while debugging one of my codes, finally answering a question I always had.
