I highly recommend using [aard 2](http://aarddict.org/) (Android only, available on f-droid) for dictionaries. I know it's a click away on the internet, but local files are just faster, especially when you are looking up a number of words.

You can install a number of dictionaries with it. I like wikitionary (1.7 GB). I generally download such "public" data on the SD card to preserve space.

You can download using your browser but I'll show how to use ftp, just for fun.

## Downloading with FTP

The list of dictionaries from the website above gives the following address for english wikitionary

[https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/aarddict/enwiki/](https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/aarddict/enwiki/)


``` bash
ftp ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de
```

This will ask you to log in. Enter `anonymous` for the username and a password you don't have to remember for the password (FTP is insecure, because it sends data in clear text. Therefore they allow anonymous log ins).

Change the dorectory

``` bash
cd /aarddict/enwiki/
```

Now get the file

``` bash
get enwiktionary-20210719.slob
```

Then `mv` to the SD card.
