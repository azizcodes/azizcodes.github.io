First let's generate some text to practice on

``` bash
cat --help > randtxt
```
Compare the line numbers from the command `nl` with and without the option `-nl`
``` bash
cat randtxt | nl
cat randtxt | nl -ba
```
The second is good for telling us actual line numbers in the file because it counts the blank lines..

Now we can do a replace command for the word `FILE`.
``` bash
cat randtxt | sed 's/FILE/DAFTAR/g' # without g, only the first occurance in the line is replaced
```

What if we just want to replace the match on the 3rd line? or certain line ranges?
``` bash
cat randtxt | sed '5 s/FILE/DAFTAR/g'
```

Extracting lines containing text matches. These commands are equivelant
``` bash
cat randtxt | nl -ba | sed -ne '/FILE/p'
cat randtxt | nl -ba | grep 'FILE'
```

Specifying line ranges for printing (or deleting `d`, or replacing `s`):
``` bash
cat randtxt |sed -ne '3p'       # printing specific line numbers
cat randtxt |sed -ne '3,7p'
cat randtxt |sed -ne '3,$p'     # to the end of the file
cat randtxt |sed -ne '3,+2 p'   # to 2 lines after the the 3rd line
```
