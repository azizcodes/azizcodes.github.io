# Javascript on Emacs

People use many settings to have javascript on emacs and it's really confusing. I prefer to keep things at an absolute minimum. So:

1. Use `js2-mode` for syntax highlighting etc because everyone says it's better. 
2. Use `indium` because it provides the functionality I care about: evaluating js on emacs.

``` javascript
// Javascript on Emacs


// Here is how to set it up (on ubuntu):

// 1. installed latest npm
// 2. installed chromium with snap
// 3. installed indium and js2 on emacs (available from melpa)

// start the process by launching the server with
// yarn start

// then on emacs,
// M-x indium-launch

a=[1,2,3].map(d=>d**4); // C-x C-e after the expression evaluates it
```

`indium` accomplishes this by connecting to a server.

I am not satisfied, the reason I like to work on emacs is its portability. I like to code while on my phone using Termux, but it seems impossible to install chromium/chrome/firefox on Termux, as of this writing. 

Someone on GitHub mentioned that it is possible to install ubuntu on Termux and work from there. I could try that. 

I could also try using their server (not working so far on Termux):

``` bash
npm install -g indium
```
